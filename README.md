# CRC-Patient-Survival-Prediction

This repository contains the official implementation code for the paper:
**"Colorectal Cancer Patient Survival Prediction Using TabNet Model"**
Presented at the *2025 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology and Applications (ICICTyA)*.

## 📌 Project Overview
This study develops an interpretable deep learning model using **TabNet** to predict the survival status (Alive/Dead) of Colorectal Cancer (CRC) patients based on clinical and demographic data. The model addresses class imbalance using the **Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN)** resampling technique and provides transparency through attention mask visualization.

## 🛠️ Installation & Requirements
To reproduce the results, please install the required dependencies.
It is recommended to use a virtual environment
